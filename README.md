# ArrayLists-LinkedList-Project
This project demonstrates my knowledge of ArrayLists and LinkedLists by reading a text file with book names. After which it:
Reads all incorrect records and places them in an ArrayList of Book objects;<br>
Reads all correct records and puts them in a singular circular linked list of Book Objects.<br>
Reads all the indexes from the ArrayList and stores them in a file called YearErr.txt._<br>

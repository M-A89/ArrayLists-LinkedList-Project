# ArrayLists-LinkedList-Project
This project demonstrates my knwoledge on ArrayLists and LinkedLists through raeding a text file with book names. After which it:
Reads all incorrect records and place them in an ArrayList of Book objects;
Reads all correct records and place them in a singular circular linked list of Book Objects.
Reads all the objects from the ArrayList and store them in a file called YearErr.txt. This will be the
end of your dealing with the ArrayList._
